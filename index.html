        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a motivated and detail-oriented Data Science and Finance student with experience in customer
            service, administration and business/corporate analysis. Passionate about finance and 
            technology in society. I pride myself on my ability to serve as the link between the worlds of technology and finance with my ability
            to translate technological jargon to financial stakeholders, and vice-versa.
            I am a self-directed learner with strong prioritisation abilities and interpersonal skills, supporting 
            cross-functional projects effectively.
