        <div class="flex-container">
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    I am a motivated and detail-oriented Data Science and Finance student with experience in customer
                    service, administration and business/corporate analysis. Passionate about finance and 
                    technology in society. I pride myself on my ability to serve as the link between the worlds of technology and finance with my ability
                    to translate technological jargon to financial stakeholders, and vice-versa.
                    I am a self-directed learner with strong prioritisation abilities and interpersonal skills, supporting 
                    cross-functional projects effectively. I hope to one day work in a field where my communication skills are utilised and I get to leave a positive impact 
                    on the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website serves as a more detailed resume. I have included links to projects I have done and more in-depth details about my industry experience.

                    <li>Collaborated with the <strong>Australian Climate Service (ACS)</strong> to solve the challenge of translating complex climate hazard data (e.g., bushfire risks and rainfall variability) into intuitive stakeholder outputs.</li>
                    <li>Awarded <strong>"Winner for Industry Impact"</strong> for developing a communication framework that successfully bridged the gap between technical data science and non-technical decision-making.</li>
                    <li>Utilised <strong>Persona Mapping</strong> and conducted stakeholder interviews to move beyond "one-size-fits-all" visualisations, pivoting the project toward a high-level <strong>Personalisation</strong> strategy.</li>
                    <li>Architected the <strong>"3 E’s" Framework</strong> (Engage, Educate, Encourage) to ensure climate data had direct and relevant implications for viewers and prompted concise next steps.</li>
                    <li>Pitched a purpose-driven narrative tailored to diverse user archetypes.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Created a full website dashboard for cost of living & quality of life metrics globally.</li>
            <li>Data was sourced, analysed and wrangled by me.</li>
            <li>Best design practices and interactivity elements added to create a more immersive and engaging experience for the viewer.</li>

            <li>Ever thought to yourself: "Wow, $18 for a schooner of beer is daylight robbery? Surely these taxes on alcohol are beyond excessive and an 
                in-depth evaluation on current policies needs to happen!"? - well here are the charts and numbers.</li>
            <li>Pub culture is a big part of Australian living, and many small businesses depend on selling alcohol to make a living. Today, we have one of
                the highest prices for alcohol in the world. I decided to make my project about alcohol prices to get a broader understanding of the issue. </li>
            <li>Used Tableau to create a dashboard for charts.</li>
            <li>Data was sourced, analysed and wrangled by me.</li>
            <li>Best design practices and interactivity elements added to create a more immersive and engaging experience for the viewer.</li>    
            <li>Tableau was a lot more limiting in what could be programmed and crammed into a dashboard as compared to full-stack web development, 
                this project served as a fun introduction to the art of creating data visualisation dashboards nontheless.</li>
